<div className="container mx-auto mt-3">
  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2 text-blue-600">Customize Your Resume for Each Job</h2>
  <p className="mb-6">
    Don't use the same resume for every role you apply to. Tailor it to the specific job description by highlighting relevant experience, skills and achievements. Remove any irrelevant information to keep the resume concise. Research the company and position so you can directly match your background.
  </p>

  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2 text-blue-600">Keep it to 1 Page for Entry Level</h2>
  <p className="mb-6">
    For entry-level roles or if you don't have extensive work history, aim to keep your resume to 1 page maximum. Use a clean, easy-to-read font like Arial or Times New Roman at 10-12 point size. Leave generous margins and white space so it's visually appealing.
  </p>



  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2 text-blue-600">Structure Your Resume Properly</h2>
  <p className="mb-6">
    Follow a consistent structure with sections for contact info, summary or objective, work experience, education and skills/achievements in this typical order. Don't alter the section order which recruiters expect to see. Use bold headings to separate sections clearly.
  </p>


  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2 text-blue-600">Write an Attention Grabbing Summary</h2>
  <p className="mb-6">
    The summary or objective statement near the top should concisely explain why you're perfect for the role. For example: "Human resources professional with 5+ years recruiting experience seeking to leverage skills at a Fortune 500 company." This grabs attention over a lengthy resume objective.
  </p>

  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2 text-blue-600">Quantify Your Accomplishments</h2>
  <p className="mb-6">
    Instead of generic statements, back up your experience with data-driven accomplishments. For example: "Reduced customer service costs by 25% through improved training procedures." Quantify whenever possible to prove your impact and stand out from other candidates.
  </p>

  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2 text-blue-600">Highlight Relevant Skills & Keywords</h2>
  <p className="mb-6">
    Incorporate the job description keywords, hard skills and soft skills required for success in this role. Optimize your resume for applicant tracking systems by including in-demand keywords highlighted in the job listing. Tailor this for each application.
  </p>

  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2 text-blue-600">Proofread Carefully</h2>
  <p className="mb-6">
    Many resumes get immediately rejected due to sloppy spelling and grammar errors. Ask 3 people to thoroughly proofread your resume before applying anywhere. Fix issues and run your resume through spelling and grammar checks in your word processor. First impressions matter greatly.
  </p>

  <p className="mb-6">
    In Conclusion, With a targeted, concise resume highlighting relevant qualifications, you've put your best foot forward for landing initial career opportunities. Following these tried and true resume writing best practices will greatly improve your chances of getting noticed and called in for interviews.
